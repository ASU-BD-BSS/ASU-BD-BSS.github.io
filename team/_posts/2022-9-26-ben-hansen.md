I'm a junior at ASU double-majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. I'm currently engaged in a machine learning project at the Biocomputing Scholars program, focusing on predicting T cell receptor binding affinity to the epitope region on MHC molecules for application in immunotherapy. My interests lie in applying computational techniques to biological systems, with a keen eye on health solutions.
