I am a Junior majoring in the Biology BS program at ASU West. I am interested in pursuing biomedical research in the future with an emphasis on pathology. Currently, my peers and I are working on a genetic algorithm project involving the evolution of macro viruses. Through the Biocomputing Scholars program, I hope to further develop my programming and technological skills in order to become a more competitive research candidate.
