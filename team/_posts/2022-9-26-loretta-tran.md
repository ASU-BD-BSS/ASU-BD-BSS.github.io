Hello, I am an undergraduate sophomore at ASU studying Informatics and working towards a certificate in Computational Life Sciences. I am interested in studying pharmacology and understanding how the body interacts with medicines, in hopes of pursuing future research in pharmacology and drug design. Currently, I am a member of the T-/B-Cell Receptor Embedding research team.
