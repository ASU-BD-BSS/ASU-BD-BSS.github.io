I am a Computer Science major currently in my Sophomore year at ASU. In the Biodesign institute, I am working with a team to research the applications of genetic mutations to Microsoft Office macro viruses. In the future I plan to continue my research into bio-inspired algorithms and possibly pursue a Master’s through ASU’s 3+1 program.
