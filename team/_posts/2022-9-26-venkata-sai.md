I am a graduate student in computer science with an interest in collaborating towards research in Computer Science. I am contributing to the BGP(Border Gateway Protocol) data science research project. My responsibilities include deep exploration of the BGP network topology, to uncover insights into diverse facets such as the influence of nation-states on network routing and the overall robustness of the global Internet infrastructure.
