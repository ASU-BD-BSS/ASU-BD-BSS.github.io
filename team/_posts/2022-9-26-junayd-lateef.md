Hello, I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. I am passionate about biomedical informatics work and research. Currently, I am working with Dr. Jed Crandall on macro viruses and how they can be generated in a genetic algorithm and testing how these viruses interact with one another and the OS they are on. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, football, and video games and also watching my favorite team the Boston Celtics when they are live.
