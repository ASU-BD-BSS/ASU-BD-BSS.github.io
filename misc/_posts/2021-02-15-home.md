# Biocomputing Scholars Program

We are now accepting applications for the Biocomputing Scholars Program at ASU for the Spring
2024 Semester! Based in the Biodesign Center for Biocomputing, Security and Society, the
Biocomputing Scholars Program seeks applications from students who are interested in
conducting research at the intersection of biology and computer science. 

## About the Center

The Biodesign Center for Biocomputing, Security and Society translates insights between
computer science and biology, with a focus on understanding and mitigating malicious behavior in
complex systems.
Deep connections between biology and computation lead to surprising insights and spark novel
approaches to many of today’s most pressing problems. Our areas of interest include immunogenetics, privacy and cybersecurity, internet freedom and software engineering.
Our interdisciplinary approach to these problems brings biology and computation together in new
ways, blending computer science, computational biology, complex systems modeling and wet lab
experiments.

## What you will do

<br>
You will work with graduate students in the Center to develop a team-based research project which you will conduct during the semester. 
The program also includes a weekly on-line presentation from Center faculty. This program is 100% online. 
<br>
Project areas will be focused on:
<br>
Evolvable Software ⋅Genomic Privacy ⋅Collective Behavior Internet Freedom ⋅Computational Biology Self-Organization ⋅Secure Computation ⋅Immunology. Complex Adaptive Systems. 
<br>
It’s important to note that with research, productivity can vary week to week. Biocomputing Scholars can expect to work anywhere between 2-10 hours per week.
Feel free to check out the team and some of our projects!

## Questions? [Contact AJ Howard](mailto:Aric.Howard@asu.edu)

The application deadline is December 9th , 2023. We will conduct  the week of December 18th and
expect to start meetings for the program by the beginning of January 2024.
Applications can be found below and
will open November 27th.
