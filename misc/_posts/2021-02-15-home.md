The <strong>Biocomputing Scholars Program</strong> is a cohort-based undergraduate research program hosted by the [Biodesign Center for Biocomputing, Security and Society (CBSS)](https://biodesign.asu.edu/biocomputing-security-and-society/
) at Arizona State University (ASU).
CBSS conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science, biology, and social systems, often with a focus on characterizing and mitigating malicious behavior in complex systems.
If you are interested in joining us in researching immunogenetics, privacy and cybersecurity, Internet freedom, evolution of software, phase transitions and emergent phenomena, and origins of complexity, see the application and eligibility requirements below.

See our [list of current projects](https://asu-bd-bss.github.io/papers/) for specific examples of research areas.

# Eligibility, Application, and Timeline

The Biocomputing Scholars Program is open to any currently enrolled undergraduate student at ASU, online or in-person, with a relevant field of study.
Most of our scholars come from Computer Science, Computer Systems Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Data Science, Mathematics, Biology, Biomedical Engineering, and Physics; but feel free to apply regardless of major if you feel you have something to contribute.

Biocomputing Scholars is a year-long program. Each week, scholars will attend a research talk or professional development session (on Zoom), followed by a meeting with their project team and mentor. Attendance to all weekly meetings is required for participation. To successfully complete the program, all scholars must present their research as a poster presentation at the end of the spring semester. 

<strong>Applications for the 2025-2026 academic year opens on Friday, June 6, 2025.</strong> You can find the application [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqCJG089AXnw6tls7C992ZtVHcLfwTqVIg2Hxsjm7OQ9_9SQ/viewform?usp=dialog). Applicants will be selected for interview on a rolling basis starting July 25, 2025. <strong>The last day to apply for the 2025-2026 cohort is August 8, 2025.<strong> Scholars admitted to the program can expect to begin their research projects shortly after the start of the fall semester. 

Note: Students who prefer a more biologically-focused or wet-lab research experience are encouraged to apply to our sister program, the [ACE Scholars Program](https://www.acescholarsprogram.com/).

# Scholar Expectations

If admitted to the program, you will be assigned to a project team of 2-5 undergraduate researchers working with a graduate student mentor and faculty member (PI) from the center.
Workload will vary by project, but you should expect to dedicate 6+ hours/week to the program in the following structure:
<ul>
    <li>1 hr/wk: Biocomputing Scholars seminar, where all scholars gather (on Zoom) for a weekly presentation from a CBSS faculty member or professional development training.</li>
    <li>1 hr/wk: Project team meeting with your graduate student mentor to discuss progress.</li>
    <li>4+ hr/wk: Independent/group work reading relevant literature, implementing ideas, visualizing results, or preparing progress updates.</li>
    
</ul>
Some faculty may additionally ask you to attend their weekly lab seminars.

At the end of the semester, project groups will present on their findings to the entire center.
Depending on the project, PIs may also ask groups to write up their research in a report or work with students to publish the research as a peer-reviewed article.

# Other Undergraduate Research Programs and Honors Theses

The Biocomputing Scholars Program is distinct from other undergraduate research opportunities at ASU, like the [Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURI)](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/), the [Grand Challenge Scholars Program](https://gcsp.engineering.asu.edu/), and the [School of Life Sciences Undergraduate Research (SOLUR)](https://sols.asu.edu/research/solur) program.
Depending on scholar readiness, some PIs may work with scholars to propose their Biocomputing Scholars research as a FURI/GCSP/SOLUR project in parallel.

Students in Barrett, the Honors College may also ask their PIs if Biocomputing Scholar research projects can support their [Barrett Honors Theses](https://students.barretthonors.asu.edu/academics/honors-thesis).
Typically, a PI will expect an honors student to extend the project or take individual intellectual ownerwhip over some aspect for it to count as a thesis.
