# Biocomputing Scholars Program

We are now accepting applications for the Biocomputing Scholars Program at ASU for the Spring
2024 Semester! Based in the Biodesign Center for Biocomputing, Security and Society, the
Biocomputing Scholars Program seeks applications from students who are interested in
conducting research at the intersection of biology and computer science. 

## About the Center

The Biodesign Center for Biocomputing, Security and Society translates insights between
computer science and biology, with a focus on understanding and mitigating malicious behavior in
complex systems.
Deep connections between biology and computation lead to surprising insights and spark novel
approaches to many of today’s most pressing problems. Our areas of interest include cancer,
immunogenetics, privacy and cybersecurity, internet freedom and software engineering.
Our interdisciplinary approach to these problems brings biology and computation together in new
ways, blending computer science, computational biology, complex systems modeling and wet lab
experiments.
