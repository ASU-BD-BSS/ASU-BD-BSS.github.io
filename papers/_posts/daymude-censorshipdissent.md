# Background

Internet censorship is increasingly used around the world, but the policies different governments and institutions use to decide what is objectionable and how to censor or punish objectionable material varies widely.
While much research effort is put into determining how Internet censorship is implemented, less focus is devoted to understanding why certain strategies are preferred over others.

# Research Goals

This project is focused on running simulations and interpreting results for a strategic model of censorship and dissent developed by Joshua Daymude, Stephanie Forrest, and Robert Axelrod.
Specifically, we want to conduct agent-based simulations to study dissent dynamics in a population and in situations where authorities change their policies in real time.

# Skills Needed

Strong mastery of algebra and calculus, python programming, data visualization

# Skills Gained

Social science, agent-based modeling, interdisciplinary interpretation
