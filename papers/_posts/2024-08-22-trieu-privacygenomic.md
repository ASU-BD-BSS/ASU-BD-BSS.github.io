# Background

The privacy-preserving processing of genomic data involves applying cryptographic and computational techniques to protect sensitive genetic information while allowing for its analysis and utilization.

# Research Goals

Our primary goals are to design and develop innovative protocols and algorithms for the processing of genomic data, focusing specifically on querying private genomic data and performing private DNA matching.
Scholars will identify the existing generic and specific approach for DNA matching, implement the protocols, and analyze their performance.

# Skills Needed

Familiarity with C++, Cryptography, Bioinformatics.

# Skills Gained

Cryptography tools including homomorphic encryption (computing on encrypted data without decrypting it, enabling secure data analysis) and secure multi-party communication (allowing multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private).
