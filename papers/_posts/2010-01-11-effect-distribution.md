# Research Goal 

Tools for repairing programs automatically frequently use mutation operators to modify the source code of the programs they target. While some work has characterized the utility of mutation operators for repair, less attention has been paid to, e.g., the amount of mutations they generate that "do no harm." This project would look into this.

# Work 

Analyze mutations generated from different operators, classify them by the effect they have on software behavior, visualize the resulting distributions of mutation effects.

# Skills Gained

Bash/Python, Stats

# Skills needed 

beginner-friendly
