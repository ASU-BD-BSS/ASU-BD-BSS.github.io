# Research Goal 

Collect radio signals at ciritical locations across campus and report findings. The important part of this is identifying interesting and important signals that could potentially come from devices emitting radio signals. Assist in the prototyping of an updated version of CryptoSluiceSDR.

# Work 

Set up an SDR (Software defined radio) and collect signals at different location on campus. Integrate with CryptoSluice for multi-party privacy preserving computation. Analyze resulting data to identify specific devices that emit radio signals on campus.

# Skills Gained

SDR, digital signals processing

# Skills Needed

Some programming (C/C++ and python preferred)
