# Background

In biology, viruses mutate and evolve to better infect and proliferate within their hhosts.
We are interested in the computational analogy of evolving computer viruses that display novel behaviors or structure compared to simple, basic starting points.

# Research Goals

Evolve Windows macroviruses that have new capabilities based on an existing malware corpus using genetic algorithms.
Set up virtual envionments, read and understand Windows macro code and the Windows execution environment.
Build genetic algorithms, write reports.

# Skills Needed

Familiarity with Windows, Linux, Source code, Python programming

# Skills Gained

Understand malware, learn cyber security skils, learn genetic algorithms design
