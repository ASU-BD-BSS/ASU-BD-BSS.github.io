# Research Goal 

SIMCoV is a spatial agent based model of a viral infection of within-host lung tissue. In the past, the simulation was fit to patient data via hand tuning. We will investigate the application of automatic optimization approaches such as genetic algorithms and gradient descent for fitting the model to patient data.

# Work 

Use hill climbing on parameters to fit to patient data

# Skills Gained

C++, Bash, Linux, Data science
