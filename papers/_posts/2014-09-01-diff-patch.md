# Research Goal 

Our work is focused on a developing set of methods that correlate a program's original source code to lower level constructs in its binary form. Our initial application targets static binary patching programs using diff-file content, but the general goal of these methods can improve human understanding of binary programs.

# Work 

- Identify set of qualifying programs based on specific qualifications, i.e., our micropatch definition
- generate small dataset for validation purposes
- identify implementation problems, filing issues in github
- help resolve identified issues

# Skills Gained

antlr4 parsetree, clang, software validation, test case development, software engineering

# Skills Needed
