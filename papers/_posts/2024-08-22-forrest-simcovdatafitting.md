# Background

SIMCoV is a spatial agent based model of a viral infection of within-host lung tissue.
In the past, the simulation was fit to patient data via hand tuning.

# Research Goals

We will investigate the application of automatic optimization approaches such as genetic algorithms and gradient descent for fitting the model to patient data.

# Skills Needed

N/A

# Skills Gained

C++, Bash, Linux, Data Science
