# Background

Radio signals emitted from mobile devices carry information about what the device is doing.
When encryption is implemented correctly by the mobile device's apps, data should appear random and be resistant to fingerprinting.
But this is often not the case, and studying public radio signals can reveal areas for security improvement.

# Research Goals

Collect radio signals at ciritical locations across campus and report findings.
The important part of this is identifying interesting and important signals that could potentially come from devices emitting radio signals.
Analyze resulting data to identify specific devices that emit radio signals on campus.
Assist in the prototyping of an updated version of CryptoSluiceSDR.

# Skills Needed

Some programming (C/C++ and python preferred)

# Skills Gained

SDR, digital signals processing
