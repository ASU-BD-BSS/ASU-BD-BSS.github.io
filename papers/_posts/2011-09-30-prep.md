# Research Goal 

Our previous work PREP, which applied 4 small static transformations to source code, demonstrated that the source code structure can influence the ability of source-based APR tools to effectively search. We'd like to extend our work on PREP by analyzing its benefit and any clear improvements.

# Work 

Analyze automatically generated repairs (C code) and/or more transformations

# Skills Gained

C, ANTLR4, and Python, Code review

# Skills needed 

Some Linux, familiarity with some high-level language (C/Java)
