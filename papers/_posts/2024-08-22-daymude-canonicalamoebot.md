# Background

The amoebot model is a formal, distributed computing model of programmable matter used to design and analyze algorithms for collective behavior.
The model had a significant overhaul in 2021-23, unifying many disparate assumptions model variants.
With the model unified, there is now significant work to be done in modernizing known results under this new analytical framework.

# Research Goals

Identify pre-canonical algorithms, update their descriptions to follow the guarded action semantics specified by the canonical amoebot model, and reanalyze their proofs to identify the assumptions they require for correctness and efficiency.

# Skills Needed

Proof writing, algorithms and theory (at least CSE 310, preferably CSE 450).

# Skills Gained

Programmable matter knowledge, distributed computing knowledge, proof writing
