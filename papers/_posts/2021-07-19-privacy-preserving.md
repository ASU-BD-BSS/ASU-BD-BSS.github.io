# Research Goal 

Design new protocol or algorithms for genomic data processing. We are interested in querying private genomic data and Private DNA matching

# Work 

-Identify the existing generic and specific approach for DNA matching. -implement the protocols and anaylises the performance.

# Skills Gained 

-Applied cryptography. -Multi-party computation. -Programming (C++).

# Skills Needed 

C++
