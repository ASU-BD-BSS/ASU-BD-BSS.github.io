# Background

Tools for repairing programs automatically frequently use mutation operators to modify the source code of the programs they target.
While some work has characterized the utility of mutation operators for repair, less attention has been paid to, e.g., the amount of mutations they generate that "do no harm."

# Research Goals

This project would look into mutation distributions with the goal of identifying patterns that can be used to improve the targeting of the search process.
