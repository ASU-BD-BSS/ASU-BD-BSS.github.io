# Research Goal 

Global Internet routing information is available in public collections such as routing tables and relationship datasets. Network studies of the Internet are often inspired by discoveries of interesting statistics within these data. We will investigate large scale network science metrics over time on these global Internet datasets to discover interesting network research points of interest.

# Work 

2 datasets (CAIDA AS Relations, public routing) see how they are different with network stats

# Skills Gained

Python, Bash/Linux Data science
