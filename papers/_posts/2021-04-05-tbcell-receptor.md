# Research Goal 

We are interested in devising new language model architectures to more effectively embed TCR/BCR sequences. Students will build/test various embedding architecture using popular models such as GRU, LSTM, and Trasnformer.

# Work 

- Identify testable hypothesis with varying model objective (masked language vs next-token prediction) as well as model architecture
- implement embedding models
- Train embeeding models
- Evaluate by training/testing downsteam task models

# Skills Gained 

Python, pyTorch, ML model training/testing/validation

# Skills Needed 

Python, Linux CLI
