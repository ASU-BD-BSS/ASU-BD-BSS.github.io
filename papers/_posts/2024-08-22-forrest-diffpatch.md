# Background

Our work is focused on a developing set of methods that correlate a program's original source code to lower level constructs in its binary form.
Our initial application targets static binary patching programs using diff-file content, but the general goal of these methods can improve human understanding of binary programs.

# Research Goals

This project will (1) identify a set of qualifying programs based on specific qualifications, i.e., our micropatch definition, (2) generate a small dataset for validation purposes, (3) identify implementation problems, filing issues in GitHub, and (4) help resolve identified issues.

# Skills Needed

C, Python, Linux, Debugging

# Skills Gained

antlr4 parsetree, clang, software validation, test case development, software engineering
